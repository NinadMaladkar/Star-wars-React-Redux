# Goal:

Build a small app where users can add Star Wars spaceships to their fleet and add passengers to it while monitoring the maximum capacity of the ships.

● Refer to the SWAPI API docs here: https://swapi.dev/documentation
● Use Redux for state management
● Users can search for starships and add the star ships to their fleet
● Users get an overview of their current fleet and see a bit of information
● Each starship in the users fleet has a maximum amount of capacity
(passengers+crew) that is shown via a bar graph inside the fleet overview
○ The bar chart gets colored automatically depending on the usage of the
capacity
● Each starship can be inspected inside a detail-view. There the user sees the
maximum capacity the passengers and the crew
● Users can add passengers to the starships (increase the amount of passengers on
board)
● Users can not add more passengers than allowed on this ship
● Users can reduce the amount of passengers from the starships
● Users can remove the starships from their fleet
● Stylize the webpage at will
● Web Page should be responsive

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
